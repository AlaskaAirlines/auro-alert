# Alert

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../docs/partials/description.md) -->
<!-- The below content is automatically added from ./../docs/partials/description.md -->
The `auro-alert` component renders errors, warnings, and other inline notifications with automated styling elements. Simply add the `type` attribute the corresponding value. If you need to present multiple lines in the same alert wrapper, use p tags for each line.

## Recommended Use and Version Control

There are two important parts of every Auro component. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">class</a> and the custom clement. The class is exported and then used as part of defining the Web Component. When importing this component as described in the <a href="#install">install</a> section, the class is imported and the `auro-alert` custom element is defined automatically.

To protect from versioning conflicts with other instances of the component being loaded, it is recommended to use our `registerComponent(name)` method and pass in a unique name.

```js
import './node_modules/@aurodesignsystem/auro-alert';
registerComponent('custom-alert');
```

This will create a new custom element that you can use in your HTML that will function identically to the `auro-alert` element.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <custom-alert type="warning">Salutations World!</custom-alert>
</div>
<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>
  ```html
  <custom-alert type="warning">Salutations World!</custom-alert>
  ```

</auro-accordion>

Installing as a direct, dev or peer dependency is up to the user installing the package.

### Design Token CSS Custom Property dependency

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/development/designTokens.md) -->
The use of any Auro custom element has a dependency on the [Auro Design Tokens](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens).

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

### CSS Custom Property fallbacks

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/cssFallbacks.md) -->
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.

## Install bundled assets from CDN

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleInstallDescription.md) -->
In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `auro-alert__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

We recommend you load these bundles using [differential serving](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) so that the browser only loads the bundle correctly. To accomplish this, the script tag for the modern bundle should have `type="module"` and the script tag.

### Bundle example code

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleUse.md) -->

```html
<!-- **NOTE:** Be sure to replace `@latest` in the URL with the version of the asset you want. @latest is NOT aware of any MAJOR releases, use at your own risk. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@aurodesignsystem/design-tokens@latest/dist/tokens/CSSCustomProperties.css" />
